                                        Connecting a web site or software application to the payment processing networks is exceptionally difficult and typically beyond the expertise and technical resources of most online merchants. Instead, merchants can connect to the Authorize.Net Payment Gateway, which provides the complex infrastructure and security necessary to ensure fast, reliable, and secure transmission of transaction data. Authorize.Net manages the routing of transactions just like a traditional credit card machine you find in the physical retail world; however, Authorize.Net uses the Internet instead of a phone line.

                                    An authorization places a hold on the transaction amount in the customer’s issuing bank. No money actually changes hands yet. For example, let’s say that the merchant is going to ship a physical product from their website. First they authorize the amount of the transaction. Then they ship the product. Only after the product is shipped does the merchant capture the transaction.
                                </p>
                                <h3>
                                    <li>
                                        Capture
                                    </li>
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    A capture essentially marks a transaction for settlement. As soon as the product is shipped, 
                                    the merchant can capture an amount up to the amount of the authorization. Usually the full 
                                    amount is captured. An example of a situation in which the whole amount is not captured might 
                                    be if the customer ordered multiple items and one of them is unavailable. It’s important to note 
                                    that a single authorization can be captured only once. If you capture only part of an authorization 
                                    amount, a new authorization will be required in order to capture more.
                                </p>

                                    Within 24 hours, Authorize.Net settles the transaction. The merchant’s acquirer then deposits the funds into the merchant’s bank account.

In such a case, the merchant may decide to refund (credit) the money. A credit is a new and distinct transaction from the original charge with its own unique transaction ID.

                                A partial authorization, also known as a <em>split-tender order</em>, is an order in which two or more transactions comprise the total amount of the order.
                                This type of transaction allows a customer to pay for one transaction with multiple payment types.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Setting &lt;allowPartialAuth&gt;true&lt;/allowPartialAuth&gt; in the request indicates that the merchant’s system can accommodate partial authorizations.
                                Without this flag, the transaction would be processed as any other and would be either fully authorized or declined due to lack of funds on the card.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If the first transaction is successfully approved for a partial amount of the total order, a split-tender ID is generated and returned to the merchant in
                                the response. This ID must be passed back with each of the remaining transactions of the group, using &lt;splitTenderId&gt;value&lt;/splitTenderId&gt;. If
                                you include both a split-tender ID and a transaction ID on the same request, an error results.

                            <p>
                                If the merchant needs to release the group of transactions before the final transaction is approved (if the balance is paid by cash, for example), send a
                                priorAuthCaptureTransaction request and include the split-tender ID instead of a transaction ID.

                                If the merchant needs to void the group before completion, send a void request, using the split-tender ID instead of a transaction ID. This action will
                                void all the transactions in the group.
                            </p>

                                The transaction is not submitted for settlement until either the merchant submits payments adding up to the full requested amount or until the merchant
                                indicates that the transaction is complete (when all or part of the remaining balance is paid in cash).

                                <p >  The Address Verification Service (AVS) is a system designed by bankcard processors to help detect suspicious credit card transaction activity. AVS matches billing address information provided by the cardholder with the cardholder’s billing address on file at the credit card 
                                issuing bank. The processing network then sends an AVS response code indicating the results of the match to the payment gateway. The AVS response code can be found in the payment
                                gateway transaction response as well as on the Transaction Detail page in the Merchant Interface. Based on the merchant’s AVS rejection settings, the
                                transaction is accepted or rejected. Rejected transactions display a transaction status of Declined (AVS Mismatch) on the Transaction Detail page. It is  important to note that the merchant cannot retrieve address information from the issuing bank; the bank provides only match or no-match information.

                                This feature enables merchants to compare the card code submitted by the customer for the transaction with the card code on file at the card issuing bank.
                                Filter settings in the Merchant Interface allow the merchant to reject transactions based on the CCV response received. To implement CCV, the merchant must
                                require the Card Code field on their payment form.<strong> </strong>

                                The Daily Velocity Filter enables merchants to specify a threshold for the number of transactions allowed per day. All transactions exceeding the threshold
                                for that day are flagged and processed according to the selected filter action. This filter is helpful in preventing certain types of fraudulent activity
                                on the merchant’s account.
